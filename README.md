# GitConvit AI Conventional Commit Message Generator

Welcome to GitConvit, an AI-powered tool that generates conventional commit messages with emojis based on the changes in your Git repository. This tool leverages the `llama3:latest` model from `ollama` to create commit messages that follow conventional commit standards, ensuring that your commit history is informative and well-structured.

## Features

- Automatically detects changes in your Git repository.
- Generates conventional commit messages with appropriate emojis.
- Interactive prompt to confirm or regenerate the commit message.
- Ensures that all changes are committed with a single, informative message.

## Emojis and Categories

The following categories and emojis are used for generating commit messages:

- `docs`: üìù
- `feat`: ‚ú®
- `fix`: üêõ
- `style`: üé®
- `refactor`: üî®
- `chore`: üöÄ
- `config`: ‚öôÔ∏è

## Prerequisites

   - Follow the instructions to install and set up `ollama` from [ollama's official documentation](https://www.ollama.com/docs).
   - Ensure that `ollama` is running and accessible at `http://localhost:11434`.
   - Ensure you have a model like `llama3:latest` configured with `ollama`.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Osama-Yusuf/GitConvit.git
    cd GitConvit
    ```

2. **Make the Script Executable**:

    chmod +x script.sh
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Ensure you have `jq` installed for processing JSON responses:
      ```bash

## Usage

To generate and use a conventional commit message, run the script:

```bash
gitconvit
```

The script will:

1. Check if you are in a Git repository.
2. Detect the changed files.
3. Generate a commit message using the AI model.
4. Prompt you to confirm or regenerate the commit message.
5. Commit and push the changes to your repository.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Check if the Current Directory is a Git Repository**:
    
    * The script ensures that the current directory is a Git repository before proceeding.
2. **Get Changed Files and Diffs**:
    
    * The script uses `git diff --name-only` and `git diff` to get the list of changed files and their diffs.
3. **Generate Commit Message**:
    
    * The script sends the changes to the AI model `llama3:latest` from `ollama` to generate a conventional commit message with an appropriate emoji.
    * The commit message follows the format specified by conventional commits.
4. **Interactive Confirmation**:
    
    * The script prompts you to either accept the generated commit message, regenerate it by pressing `r`, or abort by pressing `CTRL+C`.
5. **Commit and Push**:
    
    * Once confirmed, the script adds all changes, commits them with the generated message, and pushes to the current branch.

## Example

Here is an example of how the commit message might look:

```text
üìù docs(README.md): added installation method with docker
```
